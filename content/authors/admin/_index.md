I am a mathematics PhD student at the University of Kentucky advised by [Dr. Jing Qin](https://ms.uky.edu/~jqi229/). My research in applied mathematics and numerical methods focuses on developing new algorithms to process large data sets. I currently serve as University of Kentucky's chapter president of the [Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)](https://ms.uky.edu/~siam/) and as well as the Association of Women in Mathematics (AWM).
