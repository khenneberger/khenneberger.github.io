I recently earned my PhD in Mathematics from the University of Kentucky, where I was advised by [Dr. Jing Qin](https://ms.uky.edu/~jqi229/). My research in applied mathematics and numerical methods focused on developing new algorithms for processing large-scale data. I have a strong passion for optimization, machine learning, and data science, and I’m especially interested in applying mathematical tools to solve real-world problems. During my time at UK, I served as president of the university’s chapters of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) and the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM).
